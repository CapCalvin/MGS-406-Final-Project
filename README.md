# MGS-406-Final-Project
This final Porject is for my MGS 406 final project.

Project Description: This final project named Calvin Zhang's Book Order System. 

1: Once the customer want to buys a book from our store, the book order employee have to put in the information about the book.

2: When our book store have the book in the inventory, we will add the record into our system.

3: And we will list all the book order in the system, so the employee can see each custoemr's book order. 

Throughout this whole project, I used different programming languages such as flask, python, HTML, and mysql to complete this project. And when I ruuing my code on VM environment and Linux Ubuntu, the program is produces a well-designed executing system that solves a specified distributed book order system.
