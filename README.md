# MGS-406-Class
For this Final project, I created the book order system for different customers based on their book personal choices. 

And throughout this whole project, I used different programming language to finished this project on time such as HTML, Python, MySQL and some linux command. 

In this project, when the customer wants to buy a book or check out a book, the employee can record the information of the book and if system has it, it can add the book record to the system and create a book order information the contains all the information and customer can checkout and buy it. 

And with this project, it can increas the effiency of Calvin Zhang's book store and we can make sure that each book is corrrectly being checkouted or brought to the customer.
